### About this site

This site was made using R studio and published on github. While there are a lot of websites made by Wix.com, the github website are more professional and the coding is very complicated to a beginner. 

I would suggest a beginner go from the basic R packages like tidyverse and dplyr. R studio is a very cool intergrated developing environment, which saves us a lot of work if we are just programming the original R code.
